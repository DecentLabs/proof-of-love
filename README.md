# Proof of Love

https://proofoflove.digital/

Proof of Love preserves your love message on the Ethereum blockchain. A reference to your proof, the transaction ID is encoded into a unique printable heart. You can print and fold an origami version of this heart to hand over to your beloved one.

Proof of Love is the most durable way to engrave a love message in a publicly visible way. According to experts, the blockchain would even survive a nuclear war and preserve your feelings, unlike more traditional methods.

## Beyond Blockchain hackathon

As part of the Beyond Blockchain hackathon, we have added support for the portis.io wallet and the Ethereum Gas Station Network for gasless payments (supported by donations). Thus even no-coiners can enjoy this service to preserve these unforgettable moments on the blockchain.

The app was built at an earlier hack week at Decent Labs, however, it didn't quite get the use (one could say, Love) from users who were not already familiar with the Ethereum ecosystem and have Metamask setup and a couple of Wei stashed in their wallet. Let's just say the UX was prohibitively complex for most un-initiated users to bother.

So, we got inspired by the Portis.io API and the improved UX it enables so we integrated it into Proof of Love.  Sure enough, the app's typical usage path was reduced from about 6-7 steps (the last of which was the actual crafting of the message itself) - to just two simple steps, making the tool accessible for a much wider audience.  One doesn't need to be a cryptographer to leave a love message for the future, after all.

Gasless payments can be tested on the Ropsten testnet (mainnet support coming soon) with the special URL http://proofoflove.digital/?@3

The project is open source, available at https://github.com/DecentLabs/proof-of-love
