# Proof of Love

https://proofoflove.digital/

Proof of Love preserves your love message on the Ethereum blockchain. A reference to your proof, the transaction ID is encoded into a unique printable heart. You can print and fold an origami version of this heart to hand over to your beloved one.

Proof of Love is the most durable way to engrave a love message in a publicly visible way. According to experts, the blockchain would even survive a nuclear war and preserve your feelings, unlike more traditional methods.

As part of the Beyond Blockchain hackathon, we have added support for the portis.io wallet and the Ethereum Gas Station Network for gasless payments (supported by donations). Thus even no-coiners can enjoy this service to preserve these unforgettable moments on the blockchain.

Gasless payments can be tested on the Ropsten testnet (mainnet support coming soon) with the special URL http://proofoflove.digital/?@3

The project is open source, available at https://github.com/DecentLabs/proof-of-love
